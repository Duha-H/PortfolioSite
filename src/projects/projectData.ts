    motivation: 'Typically, whenever I start hunting for a job, I keep a text-file with a list of all applications I\'ve submitted in a particular "hunt". I continuously update that file with any changes to the status of a specific application. I prefer to keep track of my progress, and also avoid issues like submitting duplicate applications, or getting started on preparing an application to a company that I\'ve already applied to. While that helped me keep my job search organized, it didn\'t really do much in the way of helping me track my progress, or monitor my overall productivity. <br><br> I wanted to be able to notice trends in a specific "hunt", and react to them accordingly, and I was not successful in finding web-friendly tools out there that allowed me to do that. So, I went to work!',

    motivation: 'Prior to transitioning to programming and software development, I was an architecture student. At the time, I extensively used 3D modelling and rendering applications to digitally construct my designs. I\'ve been fascinated with them ever since, and that sparked my interest in computer graphics. <br> This application was a chance for me to delve behind the scenes a little more. I wanted to build a simpler version of the software I used to work with, and it was simple enough of an idea that I wanted to make it browser-based and more accessible to users and graphics programmers out there.',

I wanted the chance to experiment with different interaction techniques with a virtual environment via hand-tracking. Then a pandemic hit, and classes were cancelled. And I didn\'t have access to our VR equipment any more &#128533;. So I just pivoted to a desktop proof of concept!
